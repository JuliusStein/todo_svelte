# todo_svelte
A simple ToDo app using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and Google Firebase, with help from [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/lessons/svelte-v3-overview-firebase/).

In order to run this application, you need to create a Firebase project and add a web app to it. Then, you need to copy the Firebase config object and paste it in the `firebaseConfig` variable in `src/firebase.js`.

You can then run the app using `npm run dev` and build it using `npm run build`.
